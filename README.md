## Usage requirements

Requires Node 10.

It's recommended to use this plugin along with [serverless-offline](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline).

## Installation

Obviously, you should have [Serverless-framework](https://github.com/serverless/serverless) installed. If it's not, please start from this [guide](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/).

Then install the package:

```bash
npm install serverless-plugin-static -D
```

You can start serving the static folder by the CLI command, but probably for local development you should use [serverless-offline](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline) plugin:

```bash
npm install serverless-offline -D
```

## Quick start

Add the plugins to your serverless.yml:

```YAML
plugins:
  - serverless-plugin-static
  - serverless-offline
```

Configure the plugin by providing folder path and server port, default values are:

```YAML
custom:
  static:
    folder: ./static
    port: 8080
```

Start the application:

```bash
serverless offline start
```

You can also start serving files separately by the command:

```bash
serverless serve --folder ./static --port 8080
```

Or with the shortcuts:

```bash
serverless serve -f ./static -p 8080
```

Note: do not use CLI options with `serverless-offline start` command or any other plugins that create a server, since `port` argument will cause conflicts.
